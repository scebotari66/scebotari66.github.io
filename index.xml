I know that one adds elements to the beginning of an array, and the other removes an element, also from the beginning. But which one does what? It seems that I am not the only one who is confused. The push and pop methods are just obvious to me.
I got inspired by a tutorial from the Execute Program.</description></item><item><title>Book Notes: Test Driven Development By Example</title><link>https://scebotari66.github.io/2019/08/10/book-notes-test-driven-development-by-example/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Aug 2019 17:48:06 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://scebotari66.github.io/2019/08/10/book-notes-test-driven-development-by-example/</guid><description>I have recently finished reading the &amp;ldquo;Test Driven Development By Example&amp;rdquo; book by Kent Beck. It has been sitting on my shelf for a very long time. I have bought it after reading about the #tddisdead &amp;ldquo;movement&amp;rdquo;.
The author invites you to code along, which I did. Even if I did not write a single line of Java code in my life, I went to install IntelliJ IDEA and dived in.</description></item><item><title>Previous branch reference in Git</title><link>https://scebotari66.github.io/2019/01/27/previous-branch-reference-in-git/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jan 2019 13:45:06 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://scebotari66.github.io/2019/01/27/previous-branch-reference-in-git/</guid><description>Today I want to share a trick I borrowed from someone on Twitch. They started to commit something using Git, and after that used the following command: git checkout -. It became obvious what it does (it resembles cd - very much), but I was surprised to find out about it just now after years of using Git.
Switching back and forth between branches is very common in Git branching workflows, and is generally performed using the git checkout &amp;lt;branchname&amp;gt; command.</description></item><item><title>Setup a double branch model for GitHub Pages and Hugo</title><link>https://scebotari66.github.io/2017/10/19/setup-a-double-branch-model-for-github-pages-and-hugo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2017 16:03:32 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://scebotari66.github.io/2017/10/19/setup-a-double-branch-model-for-github-pages-and-hugo/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in my &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; post that I&amp;rsquo;ve followed Roman Coedo&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive guide for setting up this website. One key element of the setup described in his article is the two branch model: master for the generated content that will be served by GitHub Pages, and source - for keeping the Hugo source content under version control.
The approach for setting up branches described there is the following:
$ git clone git@github.</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://scebotari66.github.io/2017/10/13/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2017 14:31:06 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://scebotari66.github.io/2017/10/13/hello-world/</guid><description>The &amp;ldquo;launch a blog&amp;rdquo; item has been on my todo list for a very long time. I must admit, way too long. And it would&amp;rsquo;ve stayed there longer if I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have stumbled upon this post, which talks about setting up a blog using Github Pages, Hugo, and Travis CI. Since I haven&amp;rsquo;t used any of them, and the end result appealed to me, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to give it a try.</description></item></channel></rss>
