If you want to get a grasp of his teaching style, check out his <a href=https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/>An Interactive Guide to Flexbox</a> post.</p><p>The course itself is very comprehensive and polished. It is packed with valuable information and practical insights. I progressed through the course at a leisurely pace, and as a result, it took me about a year to complete it fully.</p><p>The author&rsquo;s teaching style feels like having a knowledgeable friend by your side, guiding you through each step. I have also enjoyed the sprinkled humor throughout the course.</p><p>Josh explains certain CSS features by making parallels to JavaScript. Some comparisons were surprisingly helpful and accurate.</p><p>The course&rsquo;s pitch header says: &ldquo;The interactive learning experience designed to help JavaScript developers become confident with CSS&rdquo;. It fully delivers on this promise.</p><p><img src=certificate-of-completion.png alt="certificate of completion"></p></div><footer class="post-footer clearfix"><p class=post-tags><span>Tagged:</span>
