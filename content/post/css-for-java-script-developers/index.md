Like many web developers, I have never formally studied CSS. I remember we had a web development course at university, but we briefly touched on CSS. It's worth noting that this was in 2011, when CSS wasn't as advanced or powerful as it is today.

CSS is often described as easy to learn but hard to master. My approach has long been "just-in-time" learning, which has served me well. However, as CSS evolves and new features are introduced, Iâ€™ve recognized the importance of updating my mental models.

There have also been many times (more than I would like to admit) when I found myself frantically adding and removing CSS properties, hoping things would eventually just work.

That is why when I stumbled upon Josh Comeau's [CSS for JavaScript Developers](https://css-for-js.dev/) course, I felt it was the perfect chance to enhance my CSS skills.

Josh has been consistently putting great content on his [blog](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/). If you want to get a grasp of his teaching style, check out his [An Interactive Guide to Flexbox](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/) post.

The course itself is very comprehensive and polished. It is packed with valuable information and practical insights. I progressed through the course at a leisurely pace, and as a result, it took me about a year to complete it fully.

The author's teaching style feels like having a knowledgeable friend by your side, guiding you through each step. I have also enjoyed the sprinkled humor throughout the course.

Josh explains certain CSS features by making parallels to JavaScript. Some comparisons were surprisingly helpful and accurate.

The course's pitch header says: "The interactive learning experience designed to help JavaScript developers become confident with CSS". It fully delivers on this promise.
