The ~~"launch a blog"~~ item has been on my todo list for a very long time. I must admit, way too long. And it would've stayed there longer if I wouldn't have stumbled upon [this post](http://rcoedo.com/post/hugo-static-site-generator/), which talks about setting up a blog using Github Pages, Hugo, and Travis CI. Since I haven't used any of them, and the end result appealed to me, I've decided to give it a try. It worked out pretty good. I've had a few stoppers, but eventually managed to move on.

As a result, I realized that the main barrier that was keeping me from starting a blog was related to the setup. I didn't want to think about the domain name, the hosting, the blogging platform. Github Pages eliminated the domain and hosting issues, and then the excitement to try out Hugo and Travis CI kept me going.

We all hear about the benefits of blogging, but always find some excuses to postpone it. In this regard, you might want to take a look at Sacha Chua's ["A No-Excuses Guide to Blogging"](http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/02/excuses-guide-blogging-pdf-epub-mobi-free-also-notes-publishing/). This free/pay-what-you-want e-book offers some bits of advice that should help you overcome 10 common blogging excuses:

 - I don't know what to write about.
 - There's so much I can't write about.
 - But I'm not an expert yet!
 - I don't want to be wrong.
 - I feel so scattered and distracted.
 - I have all these ideas, but I never finish posts...
 - I don't feel like I'm making progress towards my goals.
 - It takes too much time to write.
 - I'm too tired to write.
 - No one's going to read it anyway.

If any of these resonate with you, you should definitely go check out the book.

Anyway, welcome to my blog!
