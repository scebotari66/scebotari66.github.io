## What I'm doing nowadays

  - Living in Chisinau, Moldova
  - Diving deep into VueJS
  - Juggling with a lot of ExtJS projects
  - Listening to podcasts while commuting. My favorites: [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/), [Command Line Heroes](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes), [Rework](https://rework.fm/), [JS Party](https://changelog.com/jsparty), [Reply All](https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/)
  - Reading [Robert C. Martin Book Series](http://www.informit.com/imprint/series_detail.aspx?st=61246) (those that start with `"Clean"` for now)
