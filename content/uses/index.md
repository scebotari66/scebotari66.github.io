## Editor and Terminal

  - [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm) is my primary editor. I used [Neovim](https://neovim.io) before, but mainly switched because Webstorm has better out of the box support for ExtJS. I am looking forward to returning to Neovim soon.
  - [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) is my terminal of choice. I tried Warp, but it did not stick.
  - [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org) is the shell I use. I switched from bash long before it became the default shell on macOS. In [my dotfiles repo](https://github.com/scebotari66/dotfiles), you can access the configuration files for various command-line tools and other applications I use.

## Desktop Apps

  - [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers) is the main browser I use. I have been using it for a long time and am more comfortable with its Dev Tools than the Chrome one.
  - [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) is what I have replaced Spotlight with. Before this, I was using Alfred (I think I even paid for the Powerpack), which is also good, but I tried Raycast one day, and everything just worked, and I never looked back.
  - [Todoist](https://todoist.com) helps me manage my tasks. I have been a happy user for a couple of years now.
  - [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is where I keep all my notes.
  - [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org) is my password manager. I donâ€™t trust the cloud solutions for this kind of information.
  - [rcmd](https://lowtechguys.com/rcmd) enhances the way I interact with applications. I canâ€™t imagine going back to cmd+tabbing or, god forbid, clicking the app icon ðŸ˜„.
  - [Rectangle Pro](https://rectangleapp.com/pro) is what I have settled on for window management. I tried a few other open-source alternatives, but most had something missing.
  - [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org) is what I use for taking screenshots. I started using it in the old Ubuntu days, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it also worked for macOS.
  - [Intermission](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/intermission-breaks-for-eyes/id1439431081?mt=12) reminds me to take a break from the computer. It was annoying at the beginning, but I got used to it.
